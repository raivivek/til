# Headlines and the Inverted Pyramid

(The title is shameless taken from the book *A Mathematician Reads a Newspaper*)

A standard practice of writing in journalism, as the author claims, is to write
in inverted pyramid fashion, i.e., beginning a news story with a headline, then
a lead paragraph or two in which the Who, What, When, Where, Why and How
questions are briefly angered, followed by the body of the story, the most
salient details first. If a new idea is introduced later, its development has
this same inverted-pyramid structure: a smaller headline, followed by the lead,
and then more details.

Sounds simple enough, but why, one may ask. The advantage of this structure is
that the story may be truncated anywhere, its end cut off for typographic or
other reasons, and what remains still makes sense. A more important advantage,
both good and bad, is that the reader can read parts of the text depending on
how much information she wishes to learn.

However, one problem with this approach is that not all forms of writing will
retain its under the inverted-pyramid structure. For example, trying to
summarize the contents of a research finding into a headline or lead paragraph
might generate spurious meaning. Additionally, stories that begin by focusing on
the intriguing predicament of some engaging individual, might lose their charm
if restructured in this form.

Perhaps, a compromise of essential facts and a more leisurely fleshing of
these facts is the reasonable approach. A short inverted-pyramid followed by
longer diamond-shaped story with proper buildup.
