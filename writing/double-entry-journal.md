## Double Entry Journal

Double entry journal is a journaling technique that aims gives you an
opportunity to express your thoughts and become more involved with the material
you encounter.

In a DEJ, you typically mark the page into two vertical sections. The section on
the left contains verbatim quotes or portions of the text you wish to
understand. The corresponding right margin contains your analysis of the same.
The analysis can be a simple commentary, criticism, comments about grammar, or
further expansion of the text on the left.

The exercise stands in contrast to the passive mode of knowledge acquisition
where you read or hear something and then forget about it. By forcing yourself
to think, analyse and critique the text, you establish links between the text
and its meaning. In effect, you are talking back to the author or speaker as you
write your responses.

You can try this technique for reading as well as listening materials.
