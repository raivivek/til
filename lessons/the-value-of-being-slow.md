## The value of being slow

Today I spent a couple of valuable hours trying to setup a project and
directory structure for executing a bioinformatics program which I did not end
up using. Why? It turns out that the program already did a good enough
organization of the results that all you had to do was to simply dump the input
filepaths.

I attribute this to two things:

* Not spending enough time on documentation of the program
* Hurrying to write solutions knowing that I could do it

The second problem is a more menacing one. The fact that I knew I could do it
biased me more in favor of overlooking the first problem and re-inventing the
wheel. 

Lesson learned: Pause and read documentation. Do not let the allure of
"re-invention" fool you. Sometimes, patience is a virtue not a vice.
