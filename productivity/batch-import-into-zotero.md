## Batch import into Zotero

I was looking to batch import around 180 articles into Zotero (don't judge me), but
couldn't find a direct way to do it. Pasting PMIDs into the "Add Articles" box did not work for me.


However, what worked was following:

* Generate the list of articles you wish to be batch imported on PubMed
* Use "Send To" feature to export an XML file of all the article
* Within Zotero, Use "File > Import" and add the XML file.
* Select all articles, right click, and select "Find available PDF".

Zotero should search for available PDFs for all your articles and save them to the
library. So much winning!
