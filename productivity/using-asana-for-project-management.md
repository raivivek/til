## Using Asana for project management

Asana is a popular project management tool. Here's the workflow that works best for
planning my tasks and organizing the projects that I work with:

### Adding tasks
* Create tasks -- add them to project. If not sure, add to "Someday/Maybe" project.
* If a task has a due date or deliverable deadline, assign that date.
* If the task has specific properties, for example, waiting for input from someone, or you
  need feedback, specify a tag to indicate that.

### Organizing day
* Triage tasks into Morning/Rest-of-the-day section of the "Today" section.
* Tasks that do not need to be the same day, mark for tomorrow.
* The rest of the tasks with a deadline within a week stay in upcoming.
* You can potentially add sub-sections in Later/Upcoming section.

### Saving updates
* Use "Status Updates" to record your progress for each week or milestone. Can
  alternatively copy paste from this section to different places to share updates with
  other folks such as your PI.
* Add comments to each task to record any meetings/discussions/notes for that task. For
  instance, a bug you fixed that needed to be resolved for a task. You can record this
  issue in the task comment.

### Organizing weeks
The idea is to make non-zero and meaningful progress towards your tasks and goals. This
will be organized and evaluated every week.

### Organizing projects

Create following projects:
* PhD Roadmap
* XXXX Project
* 202X Goals
* Someday/Maybe

#### The Roadmap project
Create a PhD ROADMAP project. Think of what you want your PhD CV to look like. Put those
bigger project goals or tasks in here. Consider adding sections such as "Grants/Fellowships",
"Publications" etc.

#### 202X goals project
Add your goals for this year. Create sections for different months and add batch tasks
from other projects to this one. The tasks in here should not be as low level as they
within their own projects. This is mostly for organization and overview.

#### XXXX Project
Contains tasks and deliverables specific to a project that you are working on. You might
have one ore more of these.

#### Someday/Maybe project
Miscellaneous tasks, things you want to do in general belong here.

Happy learning!
