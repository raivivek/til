## Quickly organizing ideas

I read a psychology paper on self-experimentation that followed a neat and
consistent style of documenting the results. For example:

> # Premise: Water --> Weight Loss
> #
> # Background
> #
> # Birth of the idea
> #
> # Test
> #
> # Related results
> #
> # Discussion

This appears as an excellent structure to quickly summarize ideas, experiments,
or write a research note. The prelim analysis or a quick test of the idea can go
into the "Test" section while following discussions and observation would become
a component of the "Discussion" and "Related results" section. Of course,
"Background" is where the most important concepts are; introducing the problem
and building upon it. But what I liked most is the section "Birth of the idea".
Sometimes I struggle about sources of ideas people come up with and how they
connect the dots. This section, when well documented, could provide clarity to
my own thought process also allow me to come back later and understand why I did
what I did.
