Banzhaf Power Index
-------------------

Banzhaf power index (named after John F. Banzhaf III) is an index used to
calculate the power (the ability to influence a groupâ€™s decision in a social or
political setting, for example) of a voter in a group of coalition.

For example, a company where different people hold different percentage of
shares, an electoral college where different states have different
representatives -- leading some members of the coalition having influence in
majority of the situation compared to others. Such a shareholder or voter or
member is called a *critical voter*.
