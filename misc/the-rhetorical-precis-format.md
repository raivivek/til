In 1988, Margaret Woodworth reported on a reading/writing method that she called
"the rhetorical précis," which significantly helped students at various levels,
particularly in their reading comprehension and preparation for using source
materials in their own academic writing.

### The Rhetorical Précis Format

a) In a single coherent sentence give the following:
  -name of the author, title of the work, date in parenthesis;
  -a rhetorically accurate verb (such as "assert," "argue," "deny," "refute," "prove," disprove," "explain," etc.);
  -a that clause containing the major claim (thesis statement) of the work.

b) In a single coherent sentence give an explanation of how the author develops and supports the major claim (thesis statement).

c) In a single coherent sentence give a statement of the author's purpose, followed by an "in order" phrase.

d) In a single coherent sentence give a description of the intended audience and/or the relationship the author establishes with the audience.

Charles S. Peirce's article, "The Fixation of Belief (1877),asserts that humans
have psychological and social mechanisms designed to protect and cement (or
"fix") our beliefs.Peirce backs this claim up with descriptions of four methods
of fixing belief, pointing out the effectiveness and potential weaknesses of
each method.Peirce's purpose is to point out the ways that people commonly
establish their belief systemsin order tojolt the awareness of the reader into
considering how their own belief system may the product of such methods and to
consider what Peirce calls "the method of science" as a progressive alternative
to the other three.Given the technical language used in the article, Peirce is
writing to an well-educated audience with some knowledge of philosophy and
history and a willingness to other ways of thinking.
