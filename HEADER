# TIL (Today I Learned)

A collection of small snippets that I learn day to day across a variety of tasks I am
involved in. Often, they are curious and useful insights that I wish to share with
everyone but are too small for a full blog post.

This README is auto-generated. Please edit `HEADER` to include any persistant information.
