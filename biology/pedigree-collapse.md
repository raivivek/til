## Pedigree Collapse

Under the naive assumption that you have two parents, and each of them had two
parents, who were born to two different sets of parents .. well, in a few
generations the expected population of your family tree will become unexpectedly
high: perhaps, more than the number of humans who have ever lived on the Earth.

But clearly, that isn't the case. So what's happening?

This is explained by "Pedigree Collapse", a concept coined by Robert C.
Gunderson. According to Wikipedia,

> This apparent paradox is explained by shared ancestors, referred to as
> pedigree collapse. Instead of consisting of all different individuals, a tree
> may have multiple places occupied by a single individual. This typically happens
> when the parents of an ancestor are related to each other (sometimes unbeknownst
> to themselves).[3][4] For example, the offspring of two first cousins has at
> most only six great-grandparents instead of the normal eight. This reduction in
> the number of ancestors is pedigree collapse. It collapses the ancestor tree
> into a directed acyclic graph.
