> A central goal of genetics is to understand the links between genetic
> variation and disease. Intuitively, one might expect disease-causing variants
> to cluster into key pathways that drive disease etiology. But for complex
> traits, association signals tend to be spread across most of the
> genome—including near many genes without an obvious connection to disease. We
> propose that gene regulatory networks are sufficiently interconnected such
> that all genes expressed in disease-relevant cells are liable to affect the
> functions of core disease-related genes and that most heritability can be
> explained by effects on genes outside core pathways. We refer to this
> hypothesis as an “omnigenic” model.
